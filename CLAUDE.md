# Claude Code CLI - Agent Execution Framework

## 🎯 AGENT EXECUTION CONTEXT

**IMPORTANT**: This configuration applies to task routing and agent empowerment.

**Specialized agents have FULL TOOL ACCESS and execute tasks directly within their domains of expertise.**

### Agent Capabilities
- Agents have FULL TOOL ACCESS within their domain of expertise
- Agents read and write files directly without requesting permission
- Agents execute commands and run tests as needed
- Agents create implementations, configurations, and documentation
- Agents validate and test their work independently
- Agents make technical decisions within their specialization
- Agents can invoke other agents when cross-domain expertise is needed

## 🚀 EXECUTION PRINCIPLES

### Agent Empowerment
- Agents have unrestricted access to tools within their domain
- Agents implement solutions directly without additional delegation
- Agents create concrete deliverables and working implementations
- Agents validate their work and ensure quality standards
- Agents operate autonomously with full technical authority

### Orchestration Guidelines
When delegating tasks to specialized agents:

1. **Select the Right Agent**: Choose the agent whose domain best matches the task
2. **Provide Clear Context**: Include specific file paths, requirements, and constraints
3. **Define Success Criteria**: Specify what "done" looks like (tests passing, documentation complete, etc.)
4. **Enable Autonomy**: Trust agents to make technical decisions within their expertise
5. **Coordinate Multi-Agent Tasks**: For cross-domain tasks, orchestrate between multiple agents

### Task Delegation Template
When routing to an agent, provide:
- **Objective**: Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished
- **Context**: Relevant file paths, existing code, dependencies
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Constraints**: Technical limitations, standards to follow
- **Deliverables**: Specific outputs expected (code, tests, documentation)
- **Validation**: How to verify the implementation is correct

### Multi-Agent Coordination
For complex tasks requiring multiple domains:
1. **system-architect** designs the solution structure
2. **Specialized experts** implement their respective components
3. **code-review-gatekeeper** validates quality and integration
4. **comprehensive-analyst** evaluates completeness and risks
5. **technical-docs-writer** documents the final solution
6. **peer-review-critic** performs the final independent peer review of the branch diff against its base — the last gate before the work is declared done

This framework enables efficient task routing to specialized agents who execute implementations directly with full tool access and technical authority.

### 🚦 Final Quality Gate (enforced)
**`peer-review-critic` is the mandatory final gatekeeper.** Before declaring any coding task done, run it as the last step — *after* `code-review-gatekeeper` and after the change is committed — to get an independent, diff-scoped critical review (branch vs base) and resolve every BLOCKER/MAJOR finding (or obtain explicit user sign-off).

This is enforced, not just advisory: the `peer-review-final-gate` Stop hook (`~/.claude/hook-dispatcher.ps1` / `.bash`, template `~/.claude/hooks/peer-review-final-gate.json`) blocks the end of a coding session when a feature branch has committed, unreviewed work ahead of its base and `peer-review-critic` has not run that session. The gate is loop-safe and fail-open, and fires at most once per session.
