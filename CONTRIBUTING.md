# Contributing to the Claude Code CLI Agent Framework

This guide explains the anti-drift consistency system and how to contribute to the framework while maintaining data integrity.

## Single Source of Truth

`claude.json` is the canonical registry for the entire framework. It contains:

- **`.sub_agents`** — the roster, including each agent's model, specialization, and `focus` field
- **`.agent_categories`** — taxonomy that partitions agents into exactly one category group
- **`.consistency`** — metadata controlling generator and validator behavior:
  - `deprecated_agent_names` — retired agent identifiers (flagged if re-used)
  - `model_shorthand_map` — maps each tier shorthand to its current pinned model id, e.g. `"opus" -> "claude-opus-4-8"`. The shorthand keys (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) are the single source of truth used in both `.sub_agents[*].model` and each agent's frontmatter; the values are the runtime model ids.
  - `doc_blocks` — registry of machine-generated documentation regions

Do not hand-edit agent counts, rosters, or model assignments in documentation or scripts — they are derived from `claude.json` and the filesystem at validation time.

## Adding or Changing an Agent

Follow these steps in order:

### 1. Create the agent prompt file

Add `agents/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <agent-name>
description: <one-paragraph summary + examples>
model: <tier-shorthand>            # opus | sonnet | haiku (must match claude.json)
color: <color-name>
---

## Core Expertise
...
```

### 2. Register in `claude.json`

In the `.sub_agents` object, add an entry with `model`, `specialization`, and `focus`:

```json
"your-agent": {
  "enabled": true,
  "model": "sonnet",
  "specialization": "your_domain_area",
  "focus": "Brief focus area (1-2 sentences)"
}
```

Also add the agent to exactly one group in `.agent_categories`.

### 3. Quality enforcement is framework-wide

There is no per-agent hook to create: every agent's committed work passes through the peer-review Stop gate (`hooks/stop-peer-review-gate.ps1`, registered in `settings.template.json`). If you are adding a **hook** rather than an agent, see `commands/validate-hooks.md` ("Adding a New Hook") — implementation in `hooks/*.ps1`, registration in `settings.template.json`, behavior cases in `tests/hooks.test.ps1`.

### 4. Refresh generated documentation

Run the generator to update any `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: ... -->` marker regions:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-docs.sh --write
```

### 5. Validate the change

Run the full consistency check:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-consistency.sh
```

This runs the full check battery, including:
- Registry ↔ filesystem parity
- Category partition (no duplicates, no gaps)
- Hook registration parity (settings.template.json hooks block ↔ hooks/*.ps1: no missing scripts, no orphans, valid event names, PS7 pinned)
- JSON validity (claude.json, settings.template.json, .mcp.json; best-effort YAML)
- No use of deprecated names
- Architecture description count accuracy
- Model parity (agents/<name>.md frontmatter vs claude.json — both tier shorthand) — blocking (see note below)
- Stated-count scan (headline agent/hook/skill/command counts match derived values)
- Roster presence in prose tables (README, CLAUDE.md, list-agents.md)
- README focus-text parity (README Focus cells match claude.json .focus fields)
- Generated blocks are fresh (list-agents summary, README framework-stats footer)

All blocking checks must pass (exit 0).

### 6. Update prose tables

If the validator reports roster-presence failures in `README.md` or `CLAUDE.md` tables, add the agent row to those hand-written tables. Consult the tables' existing structure for style.

The validator will tell you exactly which tables need updates. Do not hardcode any counts in these tables — omit agent/hook counts and use phrases like "the current roster in claude.json" if needed.

## The Validator

`bash scripts/validate-consistency.sh` is the primary integrity gate. It:

- **Derives all truth at runtime** from `claude.json`, `settings.template.json`, and the filesystem — no hardcoded lists
- **Runs the full check battery** (see summary above) and collects all failures before exiting
- **Distinguishes blocking vs. advisory**: exits non-zero on any blocking check failure
- **Enforces model parity** (check 7, blocking) — each agent's frontmatter `model:` and its claude.json `.sub_agents[*].model` must be the SAME tier shorthand (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`), and every model value on either side must be a declared key in `consistency.model_shorthand_map`. A mismatch or an unknown/typo value fails CI.

Run it during development and before pushing. CI (`.github/workflows/consistency.yml`) runs it on every PR.

## The Generator

`bash scripts/generate-docs.sh` is a documentation-freshness gate. It:

- **Modes:**
  - `--write`: regenerate all `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: ... -->` marker regions from claude.json + facts
  - `--check`: verify regions are up to date; fails if any are stale
- **Machine-owned regions**: do not hand-edit content between the markers (the validator enforces freshness)
- **Coverage:** currently generates the `commands/list-agents.md` JSON summary block and the README `framework-stats` footer. Prose tables (README "## Agents", CLAUDE.md roster, list-agents.md textual categories) are hand-written and guarded by roster-presence checks instead (better structural flexibility).

Always run `--write` after editing `claude.json`, then validate.

## CI / Continuous Integration

The workflow `.github/workflows/consistency.yml` runs on every PR and push to main:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-consistency.sh       # the full check battery
bash scripts/generate-docs.sh --check      # fails if generated blocks are stale
bash tests/consistency.test.sh             # consistency test harness
```

To reproduce a CI failure locally, run these three commands from the repo root. All must exit 0. Hook behavior is tested separately with `pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/hooks.test.ps1`.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Add/update an agent | Follow the 6-step process above |
| Add a hook | See `commands/validate-hooks.md` ("Adding a New Hook") |
| Test hook behavior | `pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/hooks.test.ps1` |
| Regenerate docs | `bash scripts/generate-docs.sh --write` |
| Validate everything | `bash scripts/validate-consistency.sh && echo exit=$?` |
| Check freshness (CI mode) | `bash scripts/generate-docs.sh --check && echo exit=$?` |
| Run all tests | `bash tests/consistency.test.sh && echo exit=$?` |

## Notes

- The framework operates on **LF line endings** (configured in `.gitattributes eol=lf`). Do not commit CRLF.
- `FRAMEWORK_ROOT` environment variable overrides git discovery if set; useful for testing against isolated copies.
- Never suppress hooks with `--no-verify` unless troubleshooting a hook failure. Hook violations indicate real inconsistencies.
- Questions? See the validator output — it names every failure precisely.
