| **sequential-thinking** | Complex reasoning | Multi-step analysis, planning, strategic decision-making |

#### MCP Configuration

Create or update your MCP configuration file at `~/.claude/mcp.json` or project-specific `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serena": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@serenaai/mcp-server"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/your-username"]
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@context7/mcp-server"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sequential-thinking/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `/home/your-username` with your actual home directory path for the filesystem server
- MCP servers are installed via npm/npx when first used
- Requires Node.js/npm to be installed on your system

#### Verify MCP Configuration

```bash
# Check MCP configuration file exists
cat ~/.claude/mcp.json

# Test serena MCP server
npx -y @serenaai/mcp-server --version

# Test filesystem MCP server
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem --version
```

npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem --version

# Test MCP integration
claude "Test MCP server connection"
```

### Agent Not Found

```bash
# Verify all agents exist
ls -1 agents/*.md | wc -l  # Should show 11

# Check agent file integrity
cat agents/rust-systems-expert.md | head -10

# Verify agent YAML frontmatter
grep -A 5 "^---$" agents/rust-systems-expert.md
```

### Delegation Not Working

```bash
# Verify delegate command exists
cat commands/delegate.md | head -20

# Check CLAUDE.md configuration
cat CLAUDE.md

# Test delegation in Claude Code CLI
