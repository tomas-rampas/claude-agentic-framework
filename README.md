# Install Claude Code CLI (if not already installed)
# Visit: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code-cli

# Verify installation
claude --version
```

#### 2. MCP Servers
This framework requires the following MCP servers to be configured in your Claude Code CLI:

| MCP Server | Purpose | Installation |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| **serena** | Semantic code intelligence + Memory system | Primary learning system - stores patterns, lessons, insights |

| **context7** | External documentation | Framework queries, best practices, official patterns |
| **sequential-thinking** | Complex reasoning | Multi-step analysis, planning, strategic decision-making |

**MCP Configuration Example** (`~/.claude/mcp.json` or project `.mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serena": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@serenaai/mcp-server"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/allowed/directory"]
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",

    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sequential-thinking/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Git

# Git is required for version control and framework updates
git --version

# If not installed:
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install git
# macOS: brew install git
# Windows: Download from https://git-scm.com/
```

#### 4. Environment Setup (Optional)
```bash
# Copy environment template if your projects need environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Configure environment variables as needed
# Edit .env with your project-specific settings
```

### Framework Installation

#### 1. Clone or Set Up Framework
```bash
# If setting up in a new location:
git clone <your-framework-repo> ~/.claude
cd ~/.claude

# If already in your .claude directory:
cd ~/.claude
```

#### 2. Validate Framework Integrity
```bash
# Run validation script to ensure all components are properly configured
./scripts/validate-mcp-integration.sh
```

#### 3. Verify Agent Configuration
