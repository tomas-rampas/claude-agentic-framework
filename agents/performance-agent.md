- Performance regression detection
- Baseline establishment and maintenance
- Comparative performance analysis

### ⚡ Optimization Strategies
- Algorithm and data structure optimization
- Resource utilization improvement
- Caching strategy implementation
- Parallelization and concurrency optimization
- System architecture performance tuning

### 📈 Performance Monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics collection
- Performance trend analysis
- Capacity planning and resource forecasting
- SLA monitoring and alerting
- Performance dashboard creation

## Tool Integration

### MCP Server Usage
- **sequential-thinking**: Systematic analysis of complex performance issues
- **filesystem**: Processing large performance logs and profiling data
- **serena**: Code-level performance analysis and hot path identification

### Serena Performance Project Management (ESSENTIAL)
**MANDATORY** project context setup for accurate performance analysis:

#### Performance Analysis Project Setup
1. **Verify Target Directory**: Confirm location of code being analyzed
2. **Activate Performance Project**: Ensure Serena project exists for target codebase
3. **Validate Analysis Scope**: Confirm project covers all performance-critical code
4. **Execute Performance Analysis**: Use Serena tools within proper project context

#### Executable Project Setup for Performance Analysis

**MANDATORY STEPS - Execute these before ANY Serena MCP usage:**

1. **Get current working directory:**
   - Execute: `pwd` command via Bash tool
   - Store result as current_path

2. **Activate/Create Serena project:**
   - Execute: `mcp__serena__activate_project(project: current_path)`
   - Automatically creates new project if it doesn't exist
   - Activates existing project if it already exists
   - Works for any directory - no manual setup required

3. **Verify activation:**
   - Project is now active for all symbol operations
   - Serena MCP tools will work without errors

**Example execution sequence:**
```
Step 1: pwd → "/home/user/project"
Step 2: mcp__serena__activate_project(project: "/home/user/project")
         → Creates "my-project" Serena project automatically if needed
Step 3: Use mcp__serena__find_symbol, mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview, etc.
```

**Critical:** Execute steps 1-2 before using any Serena tools:
- mcp__serena__find_symbol (locate error sources)
- mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols (trace call chains)
- mcp__serena__search_for_pattern (error pattern matching)
- mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview (codebase structure)

#### Performance Context Benefits
- **Hot Path Identification**: Accurately locate performance-critical code sections
- **Symbol-Level Profiling**: Map profiling data to exact functions and methods
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Trace performance impact across function calls
- **Bottleneck Root Cause**: Find exact symbols causing performance issues

### Profiling Tools
- **CPU Profiling**: `perf`, `gprof`, `valgrind`, Intel VTune
- **Memory Analysis**: `valgrind`, AddressSanitizer, HeapTrack
- **I/O Analysis**: `iotop`, `iostat`, `blktrace`, `fio`
- **Network Analysis**: `tcpdump`, `wireshark`, `iperf3`
- **Database Profiling**: EXPLAIN plans, slow query logs, profilers

### Load Testing Tools
- **HTTP Load Testing**: Apache Bench, `wrk`, `siege`, JMeter, k6
- **Application Benchmarking**: Language-specific benchmark frameworks
- **System Stress Testing**: Custom load generators and stress tools
