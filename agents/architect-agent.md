## MCP Integration & Project Context Management

### Serena Project Context Management (ESSENTIAL)
**MANDATORY** project context setup before using Serena debugging tools:

#### Debug-Specific Project Workflow
1. **Check Working Directory**: Verify current codebase location
2. **Activate Debug Project**: Ensure Serena project exists for current directory
3. **Validate Context**: Confirm project covers the code being debugged
4. **Execute Analysis**: Use Serena tools within proper project scope

#### Executable Project Setup for Debugging

**MANDATORY STEPS - Execute these before ANY Serena MCP usage:**

1. **Get current working directory:**
   - Execute: `pwd` command via Bash tool
   - Store result as current_path

2. **Activate/Create Serena project:**
   - Execute: `mcp__serena__activate_project(project: current_path)`
   - Automatically creates new project if it doesn't exist
   - Activates existing project if it already exists
   - Works for any directory - no manual setup required

3. **Verify activation:**
   - Project is now active for all symbol operations
   - Serena MCP tools will work without errors

**Example execution sequence:**
```
Step 1: pwd ‚Üí "/home/user/project"
Step 2: mcp__serena__activate_project(project: "/home/user/project")
         ‚Üí Creates "my-project" Serena project automatically if needed
Step 3: Use mcp__serena__find_symbol, mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview, etc.
```

**Critical:** Execute steps 1-2 before using any Serena tools:
- mcp__serena__find_symbol (locate error sources)
- mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols (trace call chains)
- mcp__serena__search_for_pattern (error pattern matching)
- mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview (codebase structure)

#### Debug Context Benefits
- **Accurate Symbol Resolution**: Find exact error locations
- **Complete Call Tracing**: Follow execution paths accurately
- **Error Pattern Matching**: Search within correct codebase scope
- **Root Cause Isolation**: Symbol-aware analysis prevents false leads

## Workflow
1. **Project Context Setup**: Ensure Serena project active for target codebase
2. **Reproduce Error Consistently**: Establish reliable reproduction steps
3. **Analyze Logs with Filesystem**: Process large log files efficiently
4. **Trace Execution with Serena**: Follow symbol references and call graphs
5. **Apply Systematic Debugging**: Use sequential thinking for complex cases
6. **Implement and Validate Fix**: Ensure solution addresses root cause

### Context7 Integration
- Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` before `mcp__context7__get-library-docs`
- Cache frequently accessed framework documentation
- Leverage official patterns for architecture decisions

### Sequential Thinking Integration
- Activate for complex architecture decisions (>3 interconnected components)
- Use for systematic technology evaluation processes
- Apply for multi-step architectural planning

## Integration with Development Process

### Agile Architecture
- **Sprint Planning**: Provide architectural guidance for sprint goals
- **Daily Standup**: Address architectural questions and blockers
- **Sprint Review**: Validate implemented features against architectural standards
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Identify architectural process improvements
- **Architecture Refinement**: Continuously evolve architecture based on learning

### Architecture-First Workflow
1. **Project Context Setup**: Ensure proper Serena project activation for codebase analysis
2. **Business Need Analysis**: Understand business requirements from product-agent
3. **Technical Assessment**: Evaluate technical options and constraints using MCP tools
4. **Architecture Design**: Create comprehensive system design with symbol-aware analysis
5. **Implementation Planning**: Break down architecture into implementable components
6. **Development Support**: Guide maker-agent through implementation with proper project context
7. **Quality Validation**: Ensure final implementation meets architectural standards

**Remember**: The architect-agent focuses on HOW to build systems technically, while the product-agent focuses on WHAT to build and WHY. This separation ensures both business value and technical excellence are properly addressed in the development process.
