# Development Task Router v3.0

This command routes development tasks to specialized implementation agents for direct execution.

## üéØ AGENT EXECUTION CONTEXT

**IMPORTANT**: Delegated agents have FULL TOOL ACCESS and execute tasks directly within their domains of expertise.

**Agent Context**: When agents receive tasks through this router, they operate in implementation mode with unrestricted access to all necessary tools and capabilities.

## üéØ TASK TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS

### Concrete Implementation Directives
Transform vague requests into specific implementation tasks:

**Vague**: "Implement authentication"
**Concrete (Rust)**: "Create authentication module in src/auth.rs with JWT token handling, user validation, and comprehensive tests in tests/auth_tests.rs"
**Concrete (C#)**: "Create authentication module in src/Auth/AuthService.cs with JWT token handling, ASP.NET Core identity integration, and comprehensive tests in tests/Auth.Tests/AuthServiceTests.cs"
**Concrete (Go)**: "Create authentication package in internal/auth/auth.go with JWT token handling using golang-jwt, context-based middleware, and table-driven tests in auth_test.go"
**Concrete (PowerShell)**: "Create authentication module in Modules/Authentication/Authenticate-User.ps1 with Azure AD integration, secure credential handling, and Pester tests in Tests/Authentication.Tests.ps1"
**Concrete (Bash)**: "Create authentication script in scripts/auth/authenticate.sh with PAM integration, secure credential handling with gpg, and bats tests in tests/auth.bats"

**Vague**: "Add Protocol Buffer support"
**Concrete (Rust)**: "Create Protocol Buffer definitions in proto/messages.proto and implement Rust bindings in src/proto.rs with serialization benchmarks"
**Concrete (C#)**: "Create Protocol Buffer definitions in proto/messages.proto and implement C# bindings in src/Proto/Messages.cs with serialization benchmarks"
**Concrete (Go)**: "Create Protocol Buffer definitions in proto/messages.proto and implement Go bindings in internal/proto/messages.pb.go with gRPC service definitions and benchmarks"

**Vague**: "Improve performance"
**Concrete (Rust)**: "Profile existing code in src/core.rs and implement specific optimizations with before/after benchmarks in benches/performance.rs"
**Concrete (C#)**: "Profile existing code in src/Core/Engine.cs using BenchmarkDotNet and implement specific optimizations with before/after benchmarks"
**Concrete (Go)**: "Profile existing code in internal/processor/processor.go using pprof (CPU, memory, goroutine) and implement optimizations with worker pools, sync.Pool, and benchmarks"

### Specific File and Path Instructions
Always provide exact file paths and implementation details:
- Source file locations: "Create in src/modules/feature.{ext}" (use language-appropriate extension)
- Test file locations: "Add tests to tests/integration/feature_test.{ext}"
- Configuration files: "Update config/settings.{format}" (toml, json, xml based on tech stack)
- Documentation files: "Document in docs/api/feature.md with examples"

## üöÄ EXECUTION GUIDELINES

### Task Specificity Requirements
- Provide exact file paths and locations
- Specify concrete deliverables and outcomes
- Include testing and validation requirements
- Detail integration and documentation needs

### Agent Empowerment
- Agents have full tool access for their domains
- Agents execute tasks directly without further delegation
- Agents create, modify, and test code as needed
- Agents make implementation decisions within their expertise

### Quality Integration
- All implementation includes comprehensive testing
- Code review validation is mandatory before completion
- Documentation is created alongside implementation
- Performance validation for critical components
