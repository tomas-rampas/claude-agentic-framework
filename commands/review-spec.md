# /review-spec — Manual Spec Conformance Check

## Your role
Entry point only: you resolve the spec, launch the independent
`spec-compliance-reviewer` subagent, and relay its report faithfully. You do
not review yourself, soften findings, or fix anything in this command.

## Spec
**$ARGUMENTS**

- Named: use `specs/$ARGUMENTS.md`.
- No argument: if exactly one spec has `Status: approved` or `Status: built`,
  use it; otherwise list candidates and ask.
- No spec found: stop and point the user to `/spec`.

## Run

Launch the `spec-compliance-reviewer` subagent (Task tool) with:
- the spec path,
- the scope to judge: the branch diff against its base if on a feature
  branch, otherwise the working tree,
- any Spec coverage section a previous `/build` produced (as a claim to
  verify, not to trust).

## Relay

Report back to the user, unedited in substance:

1. The per-requirement lines (`REQ-001: PASS/FAIL — …`, `EDGE-…`, `SCOPE:`)
   exactly as the reviewer classified them.
2. The reviewer's fix list, if any.
3. The final `VERDICT:` line.

If the verdict is `CHANGES_REQUIRED`, offer the natural next step — apply the
fixes via `/build <name>` (which re-enters the build ⇆ review loop) — but do
not start it without the user's go-ahead: this command is a read-only check.

The review runs on the reviewer's own evidence (commands it ran, files it
read); if it reports the spec itself is untestable as written, surface that
prominently — the fix belongs in `specs/<name>.md`, via `/spec`.
