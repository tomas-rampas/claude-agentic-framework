description: Iteratively improve a code change by having the matching specialist agent score the diff 0-100 against an explicit rubric, rewriting the weakest parts, and repeating until the score plateaus. Use after the quality bar is green (build/lint/format/tests clean) but before the review gates — e.g. polishing an implementation or refactor, or when asked to "clean up" code without concrete criteria. Code-side sibling of self-scoring-loop.

# Code-Scoring Loop

The same converging loop as `self-scoring-loop` — rubric first, score, rewrite
the weakest parts, rescore until improvement stalls — adapted for code. Three
things change when the deliverable is a diff:

1. **Objective checks come first.** The toolchain already judges correctness;
   the rubric only covers what build/lint/tests *cannot* check.
2. **The author never grades their own work.** Scoring is delegated to the
   framework's specialist agents, so the score is an independent read, not a
   self-assessment.
3. **The loop feeds the gates, it does not replace them.** A polished diff
   still goes through `code-review-gatekeeper` and `peer-review-critic`
   unchanged — this loop just means it arrives pre-polished.

## When to Apply

- An implementation or refactor is green but has not been judged on the
  dimensions tests can't check (readability, error-handling completeness,
  test quality, idiomatic fit).
- Before handing a substantial diff to `code-review-gatekeeper` — fewer gate
  iterations when the obvious weaknesses are already fixed.
- The user asks to "polish", "clean up", or "tighten" code without concrete
  criteria.
- After the refactor step of a `/delegate` todo, or once a `/build` iteration
  is green before its spec-compliance review, when the change is large enough
  that a structured polish pass beats ad-hoc tidying.

## Gate zero — the quality bar

Before iteration 1, the mechanical checks of `commands/delegate.md` §4's
quality bar must be clean: build 0 errors / 0 warnings, linter clean,
formatter no diffs, full unit-test suite green. (§4's docs bullet is not part
of gate zero — in the `/delegate` flow it lands in the per-todo doc step that
follows the refactor.) Inside `/delegate`'s BDD loop this means running the
full suite at the start of the refactor step rather than waiting for §3
step 5. Correctness is binary and comes first; scoring a red build is
meaningless. If the bar fails, fix that — this loop is not for broken code.

## The Loop

1. **Scope the diff.** The unit being scored is the *change* (branch vs base,
   or the todo's touched files) — not the whole repository. Pre-existing debt
   outside the diff is out of scope.
2. **Write the rubric first — before judging.** 5–7 criteria specific to this
   change, each with a weight (weights sum to 100), drawn from what tooling
   cannot verify: naming and readability, error-handling completeness at
   boundaries, test quality (assertion strength and edge coverage — not just
   line coverage), consistency with the codebase's existing idioms, API and
   interface design, duplication and complexity, security hygiene of touched
   surfaces. Never spend rubric weight on what gate zero already enforces
   (compiles, lint-clean, formatted, tests pass) — those are preconditions,
   not criteria. The rubric is fixed for the rest of the loop.
3. **Delegate scoring to the matching specialist.** Route by the diff's
   domain per the framework routing table (`rust-expert` for a Rust diff,
   `typescript-expert` for TypeScript, …); use `comprehensive-analyst` when
   the change spans languages or no language expert fits — not
   `code-review-gatekeeper`, which must stay outside the polish loop so the
   gate's judgment remains independent of the rubric. Launch a **fresh**
   subagent instance each round and hand it the diff, the rubric, and the
   instruction to return a 0–100 score with a one-line justification per
   criterion. Score honestly — an inflated score ends the loop early and
   defeats it. If the **first** score is **≥ 90**, say so and stop — the loop
   is for improvement, not ceremony.
4. **Name the 1–2 weakest criteria** from the scorer's report and exactly why
   they lost points.
5. **Rewrite only the weak parts** (delegating to the implementing specialist
   where routing says so). Keep what scored well. Rewrites are
   **behavior-preserving**: re-run the quality bar after every rewrite; a
   rewrite that breaks a test is reverted, not argued for.
6. **Rescore and decide** — same rubric, fresh scorer instance:
   - Improvement **< 3 points**, or **3 iterations** reached → stop. More
     loops past a plateau produce churn, not quality.
   - Otherwise → back to step 4.
7. **Report** the rubric, the final score with per-criterion breakdown, and
   the score trajectory (e.g. 68 → 81 → 86) — then proceed to the framework's
   normal review gates.

## Rules

- The bar before the rubric — never score a build that isn't green.
- Scorer ≠ author, always: every score comes from a delegated fresh
  specialist run, never from the agent that wrote the code.
- Rubric before judgment, visible in the report, never revised mid-loop.
- Behavior-preserving only: never trade a passing test for a rubric point.
  Spec conformance is a gate (`spec-compliance-reviewer`), not a rubric
  criterion — requirement changes do not belong in a polish loop.
- Advisory, and strictly *before* the gates: `code-review-gatekeeper`,
  `peer-review-critic`, and the peer-review Stop gate apply unchanged. A 95
  here skips nothing.
